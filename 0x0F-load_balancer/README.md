The following are the advantages of load balancing your application:

* Reduced the work-load on an individual server.
* Large amount of work done in same time due to concurrency.
* Increased performance of your application because of faster response.
* No single point of failure. In a load balanced environment, if a server crashes the application is still up and served by the other servers in the cluster.
* When appropriate load balancing algorithm is used, it brings optimal and efficient utilization of the resources, as it eliminates the scenario of some serverâ€™s resources are getting used than others.
* Scalability: We can increase or decrease the number of servers on the fly without bringing down the application
* Load balancing increases the reliability of your enterprise application
* Increased security as the physical servers and IPs are abstract in certain cases.
